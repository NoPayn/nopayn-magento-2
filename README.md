## Installation

### Installation via Composer
Magento® 2 uses the Composer to manage the module package and the library. Composer is a dependency manager for PHP. Composer declares the libraries your project depends on and it will manage (install/update) them for you.

Check if your server has composer installed by running the following command:
```
composer -V
```
If your server doesn’t have composer installed, you can easily install it by using this manual: https://getcomposer.org/doc/00-intro.md

Step-by-step to install the Magento® 2 extension through Composer:

1. Connect to your server running Magento® 2 using SSH or another method (make sure you have access to the command line).
2. Locate your Magento® 2 project root.
3. Install the Magento® 2 extension through composer and wait till it's completed:
```
composer require nopayn/nopayn-magento-2
```
4. After that run the Magento® upgrade and clean the caches:
```
php bin/magento setup:upgrade
php bin/magento module:enable GingerPay_Payment
```
5. Continue installation from step 4 in "Manual Installation"


### Manual Installation

1. Go to `app/code` folder 
2. Unzip `nopayn.zip` attached to release 
3. After that run the Magento® upgrade and clean the caches:
```
php bin/magento setup:upgrade
php bin/magento cache:clean
```
4. If Magento® is running in production mode you also need to redeploy the static content:
```
php bin/magento setup:static-content:deploy
```
